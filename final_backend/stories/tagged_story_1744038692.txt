<Narrator><neutral>"The clearing shimmered, moon-kissed silver on ancient oaks. A chill, deeper than the forest night, settled between Oberon and Titania. Jasmine, heavy and cloying, choked the air."
<Narrator><neutral>"“He is mine,” Oberon’s voice, a low growl, snagged on the silence. His eyes, once summer-sky blue, burned sapphire-cold. “He belongs to my court.”"
<Narrator><neutral>"Titania, crowned in shadow blossoms and moonlight, stood firm. “His mother served me, Oberon. He remains under my protection. Your jealousy is unsightly.”"
<Narrator><neutral>"“Jealousy?” A mirthless laugh rasped from Oberon. “You collect affection, Titania, like a miser hoards gold.  This boy, this… plaything, is merely another trinket.  Give him to me.”"
<Narrator><neutral>"Puck, a wisp of mischief, materialized from behind an oak, bowing low with mocking grace.  “My Queen,” he offered, a vial shimmering in his hand, “shall I… persuade him?”"
<Narrator><neutral>"Titania’s gaze softened, falling upon the sleeping changeling boy nestled amongst the roots. “No, Puck. Oberon’s heart is poisoned by insecurity. He cannot grasp love’s bonds.”"
<Narrator><neutral>"Oberon’s face twisted, snatching the vial. “Then enchantment will suffice.” He flicked a drop onto the boy’s eyelid. “Let him wake with a love so absurd she’ll surrender him to break the spell.”"
<Narrator><neutral>"“Oberon, no!”  But it was too late."
<Narrator><neutral>"“Which Athenian lord, my Queen,” Puck whispered, mishearing her murmured “Lysander” as “Demetrius”, a mischievous glint in his eye, "shall we bedevil tonight?""
<Narrator><neutral>"And so, under the silent, watchful moon, the forest plunged into a chaotic ballet of mistaken love, a single drop of magic sparking a wildfire of consequences far beyond Puck's playful intent."

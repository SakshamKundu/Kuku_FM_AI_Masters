<Narrator><title>"**(Sound of a gentle stream trickling, birdsong)**"
<Narrator><title>"**Narrator:** Sunlight dappled the forest floor, filtering through the leaves of ancient trees.  A carpet of moss, soft and yielding, invited weary travellers to rest.  The air hummed with the drowsy drone of bees, busy at work amongst the wildflowers.  Here, in this tranquil haven, two lovers met in secret."
<Narrator><title>"**(Sound of footsteps approaching, rustling leaves)**"
<Narrator><title>"**Elara:** (Voice soft, breathy)  Lysander, you came!  I feared… I feared you might have changed your mind."
<Narrator><title>"**Lysander:** (Voice warm, reassuring) Never, my Elara.  I would brave any danger, cross any obstacle, to be with you."
<Narrator><title>"**Narrator:**  Lysander took Elara’s hand, his touch sending a shiver down her spine.  Their eyes met, and the world around them faded away.  In that moment, there was only them, their love a beacon in the vast wilderness."
<Narrator><title>"**Elara:**  But my father… he forbids our union. He wishes me to wed another."
<Narrator><title>"**Lysander:** (Voice hardening with resolve)  Then we shall flee, Elara.  Tonight, under the cover of darkness, we shall leave this place and begin a new life together.  Far from your father's grasp, where our love can flourish freely."
<Narrator><title>"**(Sound of Elara’s hand tightening on Lysander’s)**"
<Narrator><title>"**Narrator:**  Elara gazed into Lysander's eyes, her heart a mixture of fear and exhilaration.  The thought of leaving her home, her family, filled her with trepidation.  Yet, the prospect of a life with Lysander, a life filled with love and freedom, was too tempting to resist."
<Narrator><title>"**Elara:**  Tonight?  But where shall we go?"
<Narrator><title>"**Lysander:**  To my aunt's cottage, beyond the Whispering Woods. It is a safe haven, Elara.  No one will find us there."
<Narrator><title>"**(Sound of a twig snapping in the distance)**"
<Narrator><title>"**Narrator:** The sudden snap of a twig broke the spell.  Both Elara and Lysander turned sharply, their eyes scanning the surrounding trees.  A sense of unease settled over them, a premonition of danger lurking just beyond their sight."
<Narrator><title>"**Elara:** (Voice hushed, worried) Did you hear that?"
<Narrator><title>"**Lysander:**  Just the wind, my love.  Do not be afraid."
<Narrator><title>"**(Sound of Demetrius’ voice, angry and demanding)**"
<Narrator><title>"**Demetrius:**  Elara!  Where are you hiding, you treacherous serpent!"
<Narrator><title>"**Narrator:**  Demetrius, Elara’s betrothed, burst into the clearing, his face contorted with rage.  His eyes, burning with jealousy, fixed on Lysander.  The tranquility of the haven was shattered, replaced by the bitter sting of reality. The lovers' secret was out."
<Narrator><title>"**(Fade to black, sound of angry shouts and a struggle ensuing)**"

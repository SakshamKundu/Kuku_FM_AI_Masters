<Narrator><neutral>"The dwarves of Stone Mountain feasted. Firelight danced on beards braided with silver, reflecting the joy in their eyes.  Torvin Stonebeard, their leader, bellowed a booming laugh.  Elara Meadowlight, an elven envoy, smiled at his boisterous nature."
<Narrator><neutral>"A breathless dwarf burst in. "Orcs! In the Whispering Woods!""
<Narrator><neutral>"The hall fell silent.  Torvin's face hardened.  "Gorok," he growled, the orc chieftain’s name a curse on his lips."
<Narrator><neutral>"Axes gleamed as the dwarves marched to war. Elara, bow strung, followed."
<Narrator><neutral>"The woods, once a sanctuary, were silent, heavy with menace.  Torvin roared a challenge."
<Narrator><neutral>"Gorok, a scarred giant, emerged.  "I've come for what is mine.""
<Narrator><neutral>""The woods belong to the dwarves!""
<Narrator><neutral>""They belonged to orcs first!" Gorok snarled, hand on his axe."
<Narrator><neutral>"Steel clashed on steel.  Dwarven axes met orcish blades. Elara’s arrows flew. Torvin, a whirlwind of beard and fury, carved a path through the enemy."
<Narrator><neutral>"The battle raged.  Then, Elara discovered Gorok's secret: his people starved, their lands blighted.  His brutality was desperation."
<Narrator><neutral>"She stepped between the warring leaders, revealing the truth."
<Narrator><neutral>"Torvin hesitated, a flicker of understanding in his fierce eyes.  He lowered his axe, offering not bloodshed, but aid."
<Narrator><neutral>"Gorok, suspicious, saw the sincerity in Torvin's offer.  A truce was called.  Dwarves and orcs, once enemies, began a fragile alliance.  The Whispering Woods, a battleground, became a symbol of peace. Laughter, tinged with hope, returned to the woods."

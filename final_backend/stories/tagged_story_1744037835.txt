<Narrator><title>"**(NARRATOR):** The midday sun beat down on the dusty plains of Dustbowl Gulch, baking the parched earth to a crisp.  A lone figure, Silas, trudged through the shimmering heat haze, his weathered face etched with lines of weariness.  His canteen, long empty, bumped against his hip, a hollow reminder of his thirst.  He squinted, his eyes scanning the horizon for any sign of civilization, any hint of water."
<Narrator><title>"**(SILAS, his voice raspy):** Just a little further.  Gotta be something out there."
<Narrator><title>"**(NARRATOR):**  A buzzard circled high overhead, its shadow a dark omen against the bleached sky. Silas swatted at a persistent fly, muttering under his breath.  He stumbled, his boot catching on a loose rock, sending him sprawling onto the hot sand.  A glint of metal caught his eye. Half-buried in the dirt, a tarnished brass lamp lay partially obscured by a tumbleweed."
<Narrator><title>"**(SILAS, with a flicker of hope):** What’s this?"
<Narrator><title>"**(NARRATOR):** He picked up the lamp, brushing off the dust. It was surprisingly heavy, intricately carved with strange symbols he couldn't decipher.  On a whim, he rubbed the side with his sleeve.  A plume of vibrant purple smoke erupted from the spout, swirling and expanding before solidifying into a towering, shimmering figure."
<Narrator><title>"**(GENIE, booming voice echoing across the plains):** Greetings, mortal. You have awakened me from my slumber.  You have three wishes. Choose wisely."
<Narrator><title>"**(NARRATOR):** Silas stared, speechless, his mouth agape.  He blinked, then pinched himself.  The genie, its form constantly shifting and swirling like smoke, remained.  Its eyes, burning embers in the purple haze, fixed on him expectantly."
<Narrator><title>"**(SILAS, stammering):** I… I don’t…  Is this real?"
<Narrator><title>"**(GENIE, with a hint of impatience):** Your time is precious, mortal. Make your wish."
<Narrator><title>"**(SILAS, licking his dry lips):** Water. I wish for water.  Lots of water."
<Narrator><title>"**(NARRATOR):**  Instantly, a crystalline spring erupted from the ground, bubbling and gurgling, forming a small oasis around Silas. He plunged his face into the cool water, drinking deeply, the relief washing over him like a wave."
<Narrator><title>"**(SILAS, sighing contentedly):** Ahhh…  That’s better."
<Narrator><title>"**(GENIE):** Two wishes remain."
<Narrator><title>"**(SILAS, thoughtful):**  I wish for a shady tree, a big one, with juicy fruit."
<Narrator><title>"**(NARRATOR):** A towering oak, its branches laden with ripe, glistening fruit, sprouted from the sand beside the spring. Silas plucked a plump peach, biting into it with relish.  The juice dribbled down his chin."
<Narrator><title>"**(GENIE):** One wish remains.  Choose carefully."
<Narrator><title>"**(SILAS, looking around at his newfound paradise):**  You know what?  I’ve got water, I’ve got food, I’ve got shade.  I’m good.  You can go back to your… wherever you were."
<Narrator><title>"**(NARRATOR):**  The genie paused, its swirling form slowing.  A hint of something that might have been surprise flickered in its fiery eyes."
<Narrator><title>"**(GENIE, softly):**  You… you don’t want riches? Power?  Eternal life?"
<Narrator><title>"**(SILAS, shrugging):** Nope. I’m happy like this."
<Narrator><title>"**(NARRATOR):**  The genie smiled, a genuine smile that warmed the desert air."
<Narrator><title>"**(GENIE):**  As you wish."
<Narrator><title>"**(NARRATOR):**  The purple smoke dissipated, leaving only a faint scent of ozone in the air.  Silas sat beneath his oak tree, beside his spring, a contented sigh escaping his lips.  He had learned that sometimes, the simplest things are the greatest treasures.  The buzzard, still circling overhead, suddenly seemed less like an omen and more like a curious observer. The desert, once a desolate wasteland, now felt like home."

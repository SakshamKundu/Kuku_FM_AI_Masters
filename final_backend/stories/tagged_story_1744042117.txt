<Narrator><neutral>"The honeysuckle choked the air, thick with the scent of coming war. King Theron, armor shimmering, addressed his daughter, Lyra. "Duty calls, little bird. This war… will be long.""
<Narrator><neutral>"Lyra, sixteen, with storm-grey eyes, gripped his hand.  "Must you go? Can't another fight?""
<Narrator><neutral>"Theron's chuckle held no warmth. "A king who hides is no king at all. I fight for this land, for you." He cupped her face. "Be brave, little bird. Sing your songs, and I will return.""
<Narrator><neutral>"Years bled past, each raven a harbinger of more bloodshed.  Lyra, caged in the palace, poured her grief into her harp.  The king returned, not with victory, but with the weight of a ravaged kingdom saved by a bitter peace.  The price? Princess Amara, offered as a bride to bind the two nations."
<Narrator><neutral>""This union is necessary," Theron said, his voice hollow."
<Narrator><neutral>""But what of… your return?" Lyra whispered."
<Narrator><neutral>"Theron looked away. "A king does what is required.""
<Narrator><neutral>"The wedding was a funeral, the air thick with unspoken grief. Lyra, a ghost in her own home, watched her father become a stranger. Amara, with haunted eyes, held her own captive sorrow."
<Narrator><neutral>"One night, Lyra found Amara on the balcony. "He doesn't love me," Amara whispered. "He sees only the treaty.""
<Narrator><neutral>"Jealousy warred with empathy. "He loves *me*. But he loves this kingdom more.""
<Narrator><neutral>"A faint smile touched Amara's lips. "Perhaps love is a battlefield too.""
<Narrator><neutral>"A strange friendship bloomed. They shared stories, sorrows, silences. Lyra saw Amara's strength, forged in sacrifice.  Amara saw Lyra's compassion, her heart aching for a distant father."
<Narrator><neutral>""He told me about you," Amara confessed one evening.  "His little bird, with a voice that charms the stars.""
<Narrator><neutral>"Lyra blushed.  "He exaggerates.""
<Narrator><neutral>""He loves you, Lyra. Fiercely. And…he regrets.""
<Narrator><neutral>"Understanding dawned. He hadn't chosen Amara *over* her. He'd chosen his kingdom. His love, fractured by duty, remained. It wasn't the fairytale, but it was a truth. The kingdom found peace, and within its fragile embrace, Lyra, Amara, and Theron forged a new family, bound not by blood, but by shared sacrifice and the slow bloom of forgiveness."

<Narrator><neutral>"The ash-morn woods whispered tales of loss. Elara, silver hair catching the pre-dawn chill, tended the luminescent moss, a stubborn spark of life in the grey landscape.  Saturday, a day for quiet reflection, shattered by a rasping voice."
<Narrator><neutral>""You're early, Silas.""
<Narrator><neutral>""Couldn't sleep," he admitted, his face etched with shared grief.  "The dreamsâ€¦""
<Narrator><neutral>"The Cataclysm.  Their shared nightmare."
<Narrator><neutral>""The woods whisper of change," Silas murmured, eyes fixed on the swirling fog."
<Narrator><neutral>"A crimson flash pierced the grey, a low hum resonating through Elara.  Her hand flew to the silver locket at her chest."
<Narrator><neutral>""What was that?""
<Narrator><neutral>"Silas' eyes, usually clouded, now burned. "The answer, Elara. The answer we've been waiting for.""
<Narrator><neutral>"From the fog, a figure emerged, ethereal, bathed in crimson light. "I am the echo of what was lost," it intoned, "And the promise of what is to come." It offered a hand, swirling with light. "Come, Elara. It is time to remember.""
<Narrator><neutral>"Elara's locket pulsed with warmth.  Change. Truth.  She took the figure's hand, stepping into the crimson embrace.  The fog swallowed her, leaving Silas alone, a single tear tracing his cheek.  He clutched his own locket, glowing emerald green."
<Narrator><neutral>""It begins," he whispered to the silent woods.  "It finally begins.""
